# Tesla CF MCP Worker

Cloudflare Workers MCP server for the **Tesla Fleet API**: vehicle data reads,
**signed vehicle commands** (Vehicle Command Protocol — not the deprecated plain
REST `/command/*` endpoints), Fleet Telemetry ingest + history storage, and a
cron-driven **automation engine** (price/solar-aware charging, geofences,
conditional preconditioning, alert webhooks).

Same pattern as `solaredge-mcp-worker` / `messagebird-mcp-worker`: TypeScript,
zero runtime dependencies, bearer-token gated `/mcp` for Claude Code, OAuth shim
for claude.ai remote connectors.

## Layout

```
wrangler.toml        bindings + vars + cron (no secrets)
schema.sql           full D1 schema (reference; ensureSchema applies it automatically)
src/index.ts         router: /mcp, /ingest, /data, /.well-known, /auth, /setup, /oauth + cron handler
src/mcp.ts           MCP JSON-RPC + tool registry
src/auth.ts          Tesla tokens (KV-rotated refresh), partner setup, MCP auth + OAuth shim
src/api.ts           REST reads (vehicle_data etc.)
src/commands.ts      signed commands via signed_command
src/protocol.ts      protobuf codec + HMAC-personalized command signing
src/telemetry.ts     fleet_telemetry_config lifecycle
src/ingest.ts        POST /ingest/telemetry sink (fleet-telemetry bridge / webhooks / polls)
src/store.ts         D1 schema + generic history + KV latest state
src/tracking.ts      TeslaMate-grade derivation engine (drives, charge curve, states,
                     degradation, vampire drain, locations) + the read queries behind
                     both the MCP tools and the /data routes
src/rules.ts         automation engine: cron tick + ingest-time evaluation
src/types.ts         Env bindings, regional bases, shared types
```

## Setup — one time

### 1. Tesla developer app

1. Sign in at [developer.tesla.com](https://developer.tesla.com) and create an app.
2. **Allowed origin**: your Worker origin (e.g. `https://tesla.example.com`).
3. **Allowed redirect URI**: `https://<worker-domain>/auth/callback`.
4. Request scopes: `vehicle_device_data`, `vehicle_location`, `vehicle_cmds`,
   `vehicle_charging_cmds` (plus `openid offline_access` implicitly).
5. Note the **client ID** and **client secret**.

> The partner-account domain must be the domain that serves the public key —
> i.e. this Worker's domain. Use a custom domain route if you don't want
> `workers.dev` in your Tesla app config.

### 2. Command-signing keypair

```sh
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tesla-private-key.pem
```

The Worker derives and serves the public key itself at
`/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem` — you never host a
separate file, and the private key never leaves Worker secrets.

### 3. Deploy

**Easiest**: `./setup.sh` — does everything below (login, keygen, KV/D1
creation, secrets, double-deploy) and prints every URL you need, filled in.
Safe to re-run. Manual equivalent:

```sh
npm install
wrangler kv namespace create TESLA_KV       # put the id into wrangler.toml
wrangler d1 create tesla-cf-mcp-worker      # put the database_id into wrangler.toml
# edit wrangler.toml: TESLA_REGION, PUBLIC_ORIGIN
wrangler secret put TESLA_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put TESLA_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put TESLA_PRIVATE_KEY       # paste the PEM (multi-line ok)
wrangler secret put MCP_AUTH_TOKEN          # openssl rand -hex 32
wrangler secret put INGEST_TOKEN            # optional: separate token for the telemetry sink
wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_SECRET          # optional: signed header on outbound alert webhooks
npm run deploy
```

D1 tables are created automatically on first use.

Confirm key hosting: `curl https://<worker-domain>/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem`

### 4. Register the partner endpoint (per region)

```sh
curl -X POST https://<worker-domain>/setup/register-partner \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCP_AUTH_TOKEN"
# verify Tesla picked up the key:
curl https://<worker-domain>/setup/partner-public-key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCP_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

### 5. Owner grant (third-party token)

Open `https://<worker-domain>/auth/login?key=<MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>` in a browser,
sign in with the Tesla account that owns the vehicles, approve the scopes.
Tokens land in KV; refresh rotation is handled automatically from then on.
(Alternatively seed `wrangler secret put TESLA_REFRESH_TOKEN`.)

### 6. Pair the virtual key with each vehicle

Commands are signed with your private key, and the vehicle only accepts keys
it has been paired with. On a phone that has the Tesla app:

1. Open `https://tesla.com/_ak/<worker-domain>` (or scan it as a QR code).
2. Approve the key in the Tesla app while near the vehicle.

If you skip this, command tools fail with a clear "virtual key not paired"
error containing this link.

## Connecting clients

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http tesla https://<worker-domain>/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

**claude.ai (remote connector)** — add `https://<worker-domain>/mcp` as a
custom connector; when the OAuth screen appears, paste the `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`.

## Tools

## Telemetry ingest — getting a stream into the Worker

Tesla vehicles stream telemetry over WebSocket + mTLS (Tesla-issued client
certs) to a [fleet-telemetry](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry)
server — that TLS termination **cannot run on a Worker**. The Worker instead
exposes a plain HTTPS sink any bridge can POST to:

```
POST /ingest/telemetry
Authorization: Bearer <INGEST_TOKEN or MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>

{"vin":"5YJ3…","ts":1730000000,"data":{"Soc":72,"OutsideTemp":9.5,
  "Location":{"latitude":32.08,"longitude":34.78},"DetailedChargeState":"DetailedChargeStateCharging"}}
```

Also accepted: the fleet-telemetry JSON shape
(`{"vin":…,"createdAt":…,"data":[{"key":"Soc","value":{"stringValue":"72"}}]}`)
and batches (`{"events":[…]}`). Bridge options:

1. **Self-hosted fleet-telemetry** (small VPS/fly.io) with the kafka/zmq
   backend and a ~20-line consumer that forwards each message here.
2. **Hosted provider webhook** (e.g. Teslemetry) pointed at this endpoint.
3. **No stream at all**: automations with `"allow_poll": true` fall back to
   billed `vehicle_data` polls on the cron tick — works, costs more (see below).

Register the vehicle-side config with the `configure_telemetry` tool. Every
ingest updates the KV latest-state doc, writes a structured `positions` sample,
advances the drive/charge/state derivation engine, appends arbitrary fields to
the generic history store, and evaluates geofence/alert rules.

### Recommended stream fields

For full TeslaMate-parity tracking, stream at least these (interval seconds are
a starting point — the engine derives everything from whatever arrives):

```json
{
  "Soc": {"interval_seconds": 60}, "BatteryLevel": {"interval_seconds": 60},
  "EnergyRemaining": {"interval_seconds": 120},
  "RatedRange": {"interval_seconds": 120}, "IdealBatteryRange": {"interval_seconds": 300},
  "Location": {"interval_seconds": 30}, "VehicleSpeed": {"interval_seconds": 10},
  "Gear": {"interval_seconds": 5}, "Odometer": {"interval_seconds": 120},
  "GpsHeading": {"interval_seconds": 30},
  "DetailedChargeState": {"interval_seconds": 30},
  "ACChargingPower": {"interval_seconds": 30}, "DCChargingPower": {"interval_seconds": 30},
  "ACChargingEnergyIn": {"interval_seconds": 60}, "DCChargingEnergyIn": {"interval_seconds": 60},
  "ChargerVoltage": {"interval_seconds": 30}, "ChargeAmps": {"interval_seconds": 30},
  "ChargeLimitSoc": {"interval_seconds": 300},
  "InsideTemp": {"interval_seconds": 120}, "OutsideTemp": {"interval_seconds": 120}
}
```

`Gear` is what lets the engine cleanly bound a drive (D/R/N → driving, P →
parked) and not split at every stoplight; without it, it falls back to speed.

## Tracking (TeslaMate-grade history)

Session boundaries are **derived from raw telemetry state transitions**, not
taken from Tesla — the ingest path watches shift/speed and `charging_state`,
opens a row when a drive or charge begins, and closes it (computing the
aggregates) when it ends. An open row is the source of truth in D1, so
derivation survives Worker restarts with no bookkeeping. Nothing here ever calls
the Fleet API or wakes the car; it only processes data already pushed in.

- **Drives** (`get_drives` / `get_drive`) — start/end time & location, distance,
  duration, energy used, efficiency (Wh/km), SoC & range delta, avg/max speed &
  power, and the full GPS route for map rendering. Sub-50 m parking jitter is
  discarded.
- **Charge sessions + curve** (`get_charge_sessions` / `get_charge_curve`) —
  energy added, AC/DC type, max power, duration, cost (from a per-location price
  or a price rule), plus the per-sample curve (SoC vs power/voltage/current).
- **Battery degradation** (`get_battery_degradation`) — projected range at 100 %
  from each completed charge, and % loss since the first record. Usable pack kWh
  self-calibrates from clean charge sessions (no per-model constants).
- **Vampire drain** (`get_vampire_drain`) — SoC lost while parked, awake-idle and
  asleep (telemetry pauses on sleep and resumes on wake, so the gap is the
  drain), per-span with an average %/day.
- **State timeline** (`get_state_timeline`) — continuous driving / charging /
  online / asleep / offline / updating spans. Ingest owns the active sub-states;
  the cron's free connectivity check supplies asleep/offline/wake.
- **Locations** (`list_locations` / `set_location` / `get_location_stats`) —
  named geofences that tag drives (start/end) and charges, give per-site stats,
  and can carry a `cost_per_kwh` to price charging there. (These are for
  *logging*; the automation `geofence` rules that fire *actions* are separate.)

All of the above are exposed identically as `/data/*` REST routes (see
Dashboards) reading the same query layer.

> **Units — normalized to metric at ingest.** Tesla's Fleet API reports
> distance/range in **miles** and speed in **mph** on *both* the REST
> `vehicle_data` poll path and the Telemetry stream, for **all** vehicles
> regardless of region or GUI setting (verified against Tesla's official Fleet
> Telemetry docs, TeslaMate, and Home Assistant). `ingest.ts` converts
> `odometer`, `speed`, and the three range fields to km/(km/h) via ×1.609344
> once, before storage — so every table, derived stat, and `/data` route is
> uniformly metric. Temperatures (°C), tyre pressure (bar), energy (kWh) and
> power (kW) are already metric and pass through untouched.

## Automations

Rules are JSON documents (KV-stored) managed with `set_automation` /
`list_automations` / `delete_automation`; the engine runs on ingest events and
on a 15-minute cron. Every rule can carry `notify: ["https://…"]` webhook URLs
(MessageBird flow invocation, Make/n8n webhook, a Google Apps Script that
appends to a Sheet, …) — payloads are JSON with an `x-webhook-token` header
when `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set. Firings and errors land in `get_alert_log`.

**Safety rails**: automations can never `unlock` or open trunks (allowlist),
and never wake a sleeping vehicle. Billed polling only happens for rules with
`"allow_poll": true`, and only when the car is already online.

Price-aware charging (Amber example — cheap = charge fast, expensive = stop):

```json
{"type":"price_charging","vin":"5YJ3…","enabled":true,
 "feed":{"url":"https://api.amber.com.au/v1/sites/SITE_ID/prices/current",
         "headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer AMBER_TOKEN"},"format":"amber"},
 "cheap_below_cents":15,"amps_cheap":32,"limit_cheap":90,
 "expensive_above_cents":45,
 "notify":["https://hook.make.com/…"]}
```

Solar-surplus charging fed by your `solaredge-mcp-worker` (any URL returning
JSON with an export-watts number works; amps track the surplus each tick):

```json
{"type":"solar_surplus","vin":"5YJ3…","enabled":true,
 "source":{"url":"https://solaredge-worker.example.com/data/current?token=…",
           "json_path":"power.export_w"},
 "start_above_w":1500,"stop_below_w":500,"volts":230,"phases":1,
 "min_amps":6,"max_amps":16,
 "at":{"lat":32.0800,"lon":34.7800,"radius_m":300}}
```

Geofences (enter/exit actions — e.g. climate on when leaving the office,
sentry off + charge port open when arriving home):

```json
{"type":"geofence","vin":"5YJ3…","name":"volta-office","enabled":true,
 "lat":32.0623,"lon":34.7805,"radius_m":250,
 "on_exit":[{"command":"climate_on"},{"command":"set_temperature","args":{"temp_celsius":21}}]}
```

```json
{"type":"geofence","vin":"5YJ3…","name":"home","enabled":true,
 "lat":32.0900,"lon":34.7700,"radius_m":150,
 "on_enter":[{"command":"sentry_off"},{"command":"open_charge_port"}],
 "on_exit":[{"command":"sentry_on"},{"command":"lock"}]}
```

Conditional preconditioning the app UI can't express ("only if it's cold and
the battery can afford it"):

```json
{"type":"scheduled_precondition","vin":"5YJ3…","enabled":true,
 "time":"07:15","days":"Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri","tz_offset_minutes":180,
 "conditions":{"outside_temp_below_c":5,"soc_above":40},"temp_celsius":22}
```

Alerts (webhook per event; cooldowns prevent spam):

```json
{"type":"alert","vin":"5YJ3…","when":"door_unlocked_while_away",
 "home":{"lat":32.09,"lon":34.77,"radius_m":200},"notify":["https://…"]}
```

```json
{"type":"alert","vin":"5YJ3…","when":"soc_below","threshold":30,
 "between_hours":[22,6],"tz_offset_minutes":180,"notify":["https://…"]}
```

Other `when` values: `tire_pressure_drop` (`drop_bar`), `charging_started`,
`charging_stopped`, `unexpected_wake` (connectivity transition seen by the
cron's free check). For pure history collection without a telemetry stream:
`{"type":"log_snapshot","vin":"…","interval_minutes":60,"allow_poll":true}` —
explicitly opt-in because it's billed polling.

## Dashboards & integrations

Read-only JSON endpoints (Authorization header **or** `?token=` for
header-less consumers — note the token then appears in that consumer's logs).
Every route reads the **same D1 query layer as the MCP tools** — no duplicate
logic, so the dashboard and Claude always agree.

State & series:
- `GET /data/latest?vin=…` — Home Assistant `rest` sensor, OBS overlay, widgets.
- `GET /data/summary?vin=…` — odometer, lifetime km/energy, avg efficiency,
  drive/charge counts, total charge cost, current SoC, pack kWh.
- `GET /data/series?vin=…&field=soc&hours=168` — Grafana (JSON API datasource).
  Structured fields (soc, rated_range, speed, power, charger_power, …) come from
  `positions`; anything else from the generic history store.
- `GET /data/states?vin=…&hours=168` — driving/charging/online/asleep timeline.

Tracking:
- `GET /data/drives?vin=…&limit=50` — drive log (distance, energy, efficiency…).
- `GET /data/drive?id=…` — one drive **with its full GPS route** (map polyline).
- `GET /data/charge-sessions?vin=…&limit=50` — charge cost/energy/type table.
- `GET /data/charge-curve?session_id=…` — per-sample charge curve (SoC vs power).
- `GET /data/degradation?vin=…` — projected range at 100% + % loss over time.
- `GET /data/vampire?vin=…&days=30` — idle SoC loss, per-span + avg %/day.

Locations:
- `GET /data/locations` — named geofences.
- `GET /data/location-stats?id=…` — drives from/to, charge energy & cost here.

Make/n8n can call any MCP tool directly: `POST /mcp` with
`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get_latest_state","arguments":{"vin":"…"}}}`.

## Cost & rate-limit hygiene

- **No auto-wake.** Data reads check connectivity first and fail with guidance
  if the vehicle is asleep; only an explicit `wake_vehicle` call wakes a car.
  Automations skip (and log) instead of waking.
- **No blind polling.** MCP tools run on demand; the cron only uses the free
  connectivity endpoint unless a rule explicitly sets `allow_poll: true`.
- **Telemetry over polling.** `vehicle_data` ≈ $0.12/hr vs telemetry streaming
  ≈ $0.00667/hr. With a stream feeding `/ingest/telemetry`, automations,
  history and `get_latest_state` all run off pushed data at the cheap rate.
- Narrow reads (`get_charge_state` etc.) request only the needed
  `vehicle_data` endpoints.

## Operations

- **Health:** `GET /health` — liveness + KV/D1 dependency checks, returns 503
  if either is down (so plain HTTP monitors alert without parsing the body).
  Pass `?token=<MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>` for operational detail: whether an owner grant
  is present and each vehicle's last-sample age. The GitHub Actions tick
  (`.github/workflows/tesla-tick.yml`) checks it before each run.
- **Automation tick without a Cloudflare cron slot:** if the account is at the
  free plan's 5-cron limit, the worker's own `[triggers]` cron can't register.
  `tesla-tick.yml` calls `run_automations_now` every 15 min via GitHub cron
  instead (needs the `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` repo secret). The worker's KV tick-lock
  dedupes any overlap if a real cron slot later frees up.
- **Retention:** set `RETENTION_DAYS` (var or secret) to prune the bulky raw
  stores — `telemetry_events` and idle (non-drive) `positions` — older than
  that on each tick. Derived history (drives, charge sessions + curves, the
  state timeline, drive-route positions) is never pruned. Unset = keep forever.
- **CORS:** `/data/*` and `/mcp` send `access-control-allow-origin: *` and
  answer the `OPTIONS` preflight before the auth gate, so browser clients (the
  dashboard, MCP inspectors) work cross-origin. Safe because auth is a
  caller-held bearer token, never a cookie.

## Tests

`npm test` (vitest) — pinned invariants for the protocol codec (incl. the
uint64 varint-truncation regression), the full ingest→derivation pipeline
(drive/charge/state segmentation), imperial→metric normalization, and the auth
layer (PKCE enforcement, access-vs-refresh token separation, single-flight
refresh). D1 is backed by `node:sqlite` and KV by an in-memory adapter
(`test/helpers/`), so no live bindings are needed. `npm run typecheck` for tsc.

## Command signing notes

Commands go through `POST /api/1/vehicles/{vin}/signed_command` wrapped in a
`RoutableMessage`: a session handshake fetches the vehicle's ephemeral public
key/epoch/counter per domain (VCSEC for locks/closures, Infotainment for
charging/climate), then each command is HMAC-SHA256-signed
(HMAC-personalized scheme) with a key derived via ECDH(P-256) + SHA1 → HMAC.
Stale counter/epoch faults trigger one automatic re-handshake; "key not on
whitelist" surfaces the pairing URL above. Sessions are cached per isolate,
never in KV (counters must not be replayed).
